# About Me

I was formerly a professional electrician, plumber, and carpenter. I decided to quit life in the trades to pursue my life-long hobby as an computer enthusiast and to start acting upon the many software and app ideas that I've saved over the years. So far, I'm loving the switch! My end goals are to own a self-sufficient homestead and be in a position to help people financially who need it more than I do. Currently 28!
## My interests:

* I'm mostly interested in self-improvement, gardening, hiking, foraging, exercise, reading, and most recently, **programming**.
